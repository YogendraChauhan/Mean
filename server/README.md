# MEAN 5
A Sample Application Using Mongo, Express, Angular5 &amp; Node


#### The Full Stack Javascript Framework.

MEAN is a combination of MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js.
With <strong>MEAN 5</strong> we are providing the ability to mix and match latest frontend frameworks, databases and technologies.
We aim to create a robust, flexible and scalable full-stack javascript solution.

The default MEAN stack you get out of the box can work with either Angular or React and is built with the following technologies...

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Angular](https://angular.io)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) 

## Prerequisite Technologies

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
* [Node 7.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [NPM 4.x] ( or yarn)
* [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Installation

To start your application with MEAN, you need to clone the base MEAN repository from Github. This repository contains all the packages, modules and also a sample code base in order to start and make it easy to develop your application. Following the steps below will guide you to install the latest MEAN version.

```
git clone https://github.com/YogendraChauhan/Mean  
cd mean
npm install  
npm start  
npm install -g nodemon  
nodemon
```

If all the packages and modules installed successfully, your default web browser will open and you can see the default MEAN application at `http://localhost:3000`. This is the default port unless you change that manually.

## Additional Tools used in MEAN

* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html)
* [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/)
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)
